# Verdict — EPOCH-EDGE-SPECS-CODEX-2

VERDICT: SAFE

Basis:
- Install completed successfully (`INSTALL.log`).
- `verify:specs` passed twice (`gates/verify_specs_run1.log`, `gates/verify_specs_run2.log`).
- Required EDGE docs/specs/index/ledger/gate-range updates are present and diff-captured (`DIFF.patch`).

Next action:
- Start E31 implementation sprint using the new contract and evidence blueprint.
