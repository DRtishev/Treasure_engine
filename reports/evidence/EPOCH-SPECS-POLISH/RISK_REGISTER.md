# RISK REGISTER
- Technical risk: over-strict checker blocks legitimate future spec evolution.
- Operational risk: docs drift between template and existing epochs may reappear.
- Meta-risk: false PASS if checker validates only headings but not actionable content depth.
- Process risk: evidence/manifest steps can become stale if not rerun after late doc edits.
