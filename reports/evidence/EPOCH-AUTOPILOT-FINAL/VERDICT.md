# VERDICT
Status: SAFE

## Decision
Autopilot docs/spec/ledger/executor hardening completed with offline wall proof, release governor validation, and evidence pack completeness.

## Evidence paths
- reports/evidence/EPOCH-AUTOPILOT-FINAL/
- reports/evidence/EPOCH-AUTOPILOT-FINAL/gates/
- reports/evidence/EPOCH-AUTOPILOT-FINAL/manifests/

## Limitations
- Full wall runtime is heavy; local reruns are time-consuming but deterministic.
