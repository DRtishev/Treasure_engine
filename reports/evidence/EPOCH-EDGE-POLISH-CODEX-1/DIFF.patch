-# AI Module Specification (EDGE)
+# AI Module Specification (EDGE, No-Delusion Edition)
 
-## 1) Allowed vs Forbidden Behaviors
-### Allowed
-- Offline training and evaluation on immutable point-in-time snapshots.
-- Deterministic pipelines with explicit seeds, ordered processing, pinned dependencies.
-- Model comparison using pre-committed WFO/CPCV protocols.
-- Shadow inference only for deployment stages in this EDGE scope.
+## Operator Summary
+- This document defines AI behavior limits for EDGE epochs.
+- AI is decision-support under risk governance; it is never self-authorizing.
+- Offline-first and deterministic replay are mandatory.
+- Training in production runtime is forbidden.
+- Hidden network calls are forbidden by default.
+- Future leakage is a hard fail condition.
+- Model promotion requires immutable registry records and evidence links.
+- Drift/degradation must trigger confidence caps and risk escalation.
+- Shadow mode cannot place orders.
+- All AI claims require reproducible logs and fingerprints.
 
-### Forbidden
-- Training in production runtime.
-- Auto-updating model weights without manifest + promotion gate.
-- Using unlabeled external live data in default verification path.
-- Any behavior that bypasses risk brain or kill-switch policy.
-- Hidden network calls when `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS` is unset.
+## Where to look next
+- WFO/leakage epoch spec: `specs/epochs/EPOCH-37.md`.
+- Gap monitor and braking: `specs/epochs/EPOCH-38.md`.
+- Shadow and canary governor: `specs/epochs/EPOCH-39.md`.
 
-## 2) Deterministic Training/Inference Contract
-Required fields for all AI run records:
+## Allowed behaviors
+- Offline training/inference over immutable point-in-time snapshots.
+- Deterministic replay with fixed seeds and pinned dependency manifests.
+- Registered model promotion via explicit gates and approvals.
+- Shadow inference outputting Signal/Intent candidates only.
+
+## Forbidden behaviors
+- Training on future labels or post-event revised data.
+- Hidden network calls when `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS` is not `1`.
+- Auto-trade or direct order placement from AI outputs.
+- Dynamic dependency upgrades during train/infer runs.
+- Unlogged decisions or missing rationale fields.
+
+## Deterministic contract
+Required AI run fields:
 - `schema_version`, `model_id`, `model_semver`, `seed`, `dataset_snapshot_id`, `feature_manifest_hash`, `code_commit_sha`, `dependency_lock_hash`, `deterministic_fingerprint`.
 
-Rules:
-- Data iteration order must be stable and logged.
-- Seed controls all stochastic components.
-- Floating-point precision and library versions must be pinned.
-- Inference on same model + same features must produce identical outputs bitwise (or declared tolerance with fixed serializer).
+Determinism requirements:
+- Stable sample ordering must be persisted in run manifest.
+- Floating policy: deterministic decimal rounding (`price:1e-8`, `score:1e-6`, `prob:1e-6`).
+- Fingerprint policy: `sha256(canonical_json(run_inputs + config + seed + model_artifact_hash))`.
+- Rerun drift rule: identical inputs must yield identical fingerprint; otherwise gate FAIL.
+
+## Dataset discipline + leakage controls
+- Point-in-time snapshots only; no forward-filled future labels.
+- Strict train/validation/test split records.
+- Purging/embargo required when label horizons overlap split boundaries.
+- Leakage battery:
+  - Positive control: inject known future leakage; sentinel must fail.
+  - Negative control: clean data; sentinel must pass.
 
-## 3) Dataset Discipline + Leakage Fixtures
-- All datasets are point-in-time snapshots with timestamp monotonicity checks.
-- Positive-control leakage fixture: inject future label artifact; sentinel must fail.
-- Negative-control fixture: no injected leakage; sentinel must pass.
-- Normalization/transforms fit only on train partition and serialize fit statistics.
+## Model registry and promotion rules
+- Immutable model card fields: objective, data snapshot refs, metrics, risk notes, known limits, evidence links.
+- Semver:
+  - MAJOR: feature/label contract break.
+  - MINOR: compatible model upgrade.
+  - PATCH: metadata/bugfix, unchanged contract.
+- Promotion gate requires all: leakage battery pass, deterministic replay pass, OOS threshold pass, risk signoff.
 
-## 4) Model Registry + Promotion Rules
-- Registry record includes `model_id`, `semver`, `training_manifest`, `evaluation_manifest`, `model_card`, and artifact hashes.
-- Semver policy:
-  - MAJOR: incompatible feature schema or target definition.
-  - MINOR: compatible algorithmic improvements.
-  - PATCH: metadata/bugfix with unchanged behavior contract.
-- Model card is immutable once promoted and must link evidence files.
-- Promotion requires passing deterministic replay, leakage battery, and WFO thresholds.
+## Evaluation baseline + calibration
+Mandatory minimum metrics:
+- OOS Sharpe (HEURISTIC floor by asset class, calibrated quarterly).
+- Max drawdown OOS (HEURISTIC ceiling, calibrated quarterly).
+- Hit-rate stability across seeds.
+- IS→OOS degradation ratio.
 
-## 5) Evaluation Framework
-- Baseline mandatory: pre-committed Walk-Forward Optimization windows.
-- Optional technique set (HEURISTIC integration priority): CPCV, PBO, DSR, SPA, White Reality Check.
-- Purging/embargo required where label overlap exists.
-- Overfit court compares IS vs OOS degradation and seed dispersion.
+Technique options (as applicable): CPCV, PBO, DSR, SPA, White Reality Check.
+All unsourced thresholds must be marked **HEURISTIC** and include calibration protocol.
 
-## 6) Degradation + Safety Interplay
-- Confidence caps reduce intent sizes when model uncertainty rises.
-- Auto-brake integration: high drift or confidence collapse triggers risk mode escalation.
-- Risk brain retains authority; AI module cannot override HALTED mode.
-- Degradation path: FULL model -> conservative model -> no-trade fallback.
+## Degradation and safety interplay
+- Confidence caps reduce intent sizing when uncertainty increases.
+- Confidence collapse or instability triggers risk mode escalation.
+- Safe fallback chain: primary model → conservative baseline model → no-trade.
+- HALTED risk mode is non-bypassable by AI module.
 
-## 7) Proof Gates for AI Honesty
-Mandatory gate outcomes:
-1. **Leakage Injection Test**: injected future leakage must be detected and fail gate.
-2. **Seed Replay Test**: repeated run with same seed must reproduce identical fingerprints.
-3. **Cross-Seed Stability Test**: performance dispersion beyond configured HEURISTIC threshold triggers warning/block.
-4. **Drift Instability Test**: synthetic unstable drift scenario must force failure and brake action.
+## Proof gates (must be reproducible)
+1. Leakage injected fixture must FAIL.
+2. Clean fixture must PASS.
+3. Same-seed replay must be fingerprint-identical.
+4. Cross-seed dispersion beyond HEURISTIC bound must WARN/FAIL per policy.
+5. Drift stress fixture must trigger auto-brake evidence.
 
-## 8) Evidence Requirements
+## Required evidence files
 - `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/ai/AI_RUN_MANIFEST.json`
 - `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/ai/LEAKAGE_POSITIVE_CONTROL.log`
 - `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/ai/LEAKAGE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL.log`
 - `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/ai/SEED_REPLAY_DIFF.log`
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/ai/DRIFT_FAIL_PROOF.log`

+# EDGE Anti-Patterns Hit List
+
+## Operator Summary
+- This is a fail-fast checklist, not a suggestion list.
+- Each anti-pattern includes symptom, impact, detection test, mitigation.
+- Any detected item must map to a blocking or warning gate state.
+- Focus areas: leakage, determinism, realism, risk, governance, evidence integrity.
+- Use this list during design review and gate implementation.

+- If an item has no mitigation owner, operations are unsafe.
+- Do not waive anti-patterns without written risk acceptance.
+- Shadow safety and no-live-default are mandatory.
+- Evidence theater is treated as a critical operational defect.

-# Recommended Stack for EDGE Epochs
+# Recommended EDGE Stack
 
-## Primary stack (Node-first)
-- Runtime: Node.js LTS (pinned major/minor in lockfile + CI image).
-- Data contracts: JSON Schema + Ajv for validation.
-- Deterministic storage: local append-only snapshots + manifests (`sha256`).
-- Evidence tooling: npm scripts + run-scoped logs under `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/`.
-- Local DB (optional): SQLite with deterministic PRAGMA settings for ordering and journaling.
+## Operator Summary
+- Node-first stack is canonical for runtime and gates.
+- Python is optional and research-only behind explicit feature flag.
+- Offline-first dataset contracts are mandatory.
+- All artifacts must be hash-addressable and immutable.
+- Default gates must pass without internet.
+- Deterministic serialization and rounding rules are non-optional.
+- Registry/promotion requires evidence links and lock hashes.
+- Shadow mode remains no-order by default.
+- Runtime and lab paths must converge on identical contracts.
+- Any stack change requires decision-matrix update.
 
-## Optional stack: Node core + Python lab
-- Enabled only behind `ENABLE_PYTHON_LAB=1`.
-- Python is research-only for model experimentation, never default production path.
-- Python outputs must be exported to canonical JSON contracts consumed by Node core.
-- If disabled, all gates must still pass.
+## Where to look next
+- AI controls: `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/AI_MODULE.md`.
+- Contract definitions: `docs/SDD_EDGE_EPOCHS_31_40.md`.
+
+## Primary runtime (canonical)
+- Node.js LTS + npm lockfile.
+- JSON Schema + Ajv validation.
+- Deterministic persistence via immutable manifests and optional SQLite.
+- Evidence scripts writing to `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/`.
+
+## Optional lab mode
+- `ENABLE_PYTHON_LAB=1` gates Python research tools.
+- Python outputs must be exported to canonical JSON contracts.
+- Runtime remains Node-first; no production dependency on Python lab.
 
 ## Offline dataset contract
-Every dataset snapshot requires:
-1. `manifest.json` containing snapshot id, source, rows, ts range, schema version.
-2. `sha256sum.txt` with checksums for every data file.
-3. `schema.json` pinned to snapshot.
-4. `deps.lock`/`environment manifest` for extractor dependencies.
+Each snapshot requires:
+1. `manifest.json` (snapshot id, schema version, source, row counts, timestamp range).
+2. `sha256sum.txt` (all files checksummed).
+3. `schema.json` (pinned shape).
+4. `deps.lock` or equivalent environment hash.
+5. `split_map.json` (train/validation/test boundaries and embargo metadata).
 
-## Determinism controls
-- Canonical sorting before hash generation.
-- Fixed seed policy per run (`SEED` required for stochastic methods).
-- Stable float serialization and UTC timestamps.
-- Explicit train/test boundary metadata for every model/feature run.
+## Determinism doctrine
+- Seed required for stochastic paths.
+- Stable ordering by `(symbol, timestamp, row_id)`.
+- Rounding policy: prices/sizes 1e-8, returns/scores 1e-6.
+- Fingerprint policy: sha256 over canonical JSON + parent hashes + seed.
 
-## Governance controls
-- Promotion only from immutable artifacts with manifests and evidence links.
-- Shadow-only default runtime; live order path blocked unless dedicated unlock epoch.
-- Replay gate must reproduce identical fingerprints for same seed and manifests.
+## Safety doctrine
+- Network paths disabled unless `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.
+- Live orders disabled by default; shadow asserts `orders_submitted==0`.
+- Promotion requires deterministic replay + leakage controls + risk approval.

-## Usage notes
-- Numeric thresholds without strong source are labeled **HEURISTIC** in specs and require calibration procedure.
-- Any technique mention (PBO/DSR/SPA/WRC) in epoch specs is an option set, not a mandatory implementation in this authoring phase.
+## HEURISTIC policy
+- Any threshold without Tier-1 backing must be labeled **HEURISTIC**.
+- HEURISTIC thresholds require quarterly calibration evidence (data window, objective, selected value, rollback guard).

 # SDD — EDGE Epochs 31→40
 
-## Scope
-This document defines the architecture blueprint for E31..E40 as an implementation contract. It is specification-only; runtime behavior is implemented in subsequent sprints.
+## Operator Summary
+- This SDD is the single architecture blueprint for EDGE epochs E31..E40.
+- Scope is specification only: no runtime trading implementation in this cycle.
+- Offline-first is mandatory; network paths require `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.
+- Determinism is mandatory: same inputs + seed + config = same fingerprint.
+- Point-in-time data discipline is mandatory: no future leakage.
+- Shadow/canary must remain no-order by default.
+- Every epoch defines explicit contracts, invariants, and fail-fast stop rules.
+- Every gate must produce evidence artifacts under `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/`.
+- READY in ledger means implementation-ready spec, not runtime completed.
+- E40 release freeze requires clean-clone reproducibility and certification report.
+
+## Where to look next
+- Per-epoch implementation contracts: `specs/epochs/EPOCH-31.md` ... `EPOCH-40.md`.
+- Research basis and scoring: `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/SOURCES.md` and `DECISION_MATRIX.md`.
+- AI governance and honesty proofs: `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/AI_MODULE.md`.
+
+## Canonical Glossary (Consistency Sweep)
+- **FeatureFrame**: point-in-time feature row keyed by symbol/timestamp and provenance.
+- **StrategyManifest**: immutable semver contract for a strategy artifact.
+- **Signal**: strategy output hypothesis with confidence and reasons.
+- **Intent**: constrained executable instruction derived from signal.
+- **Order**: exchange-facing object (forbidden in shadow mode by default).
+- **Fill**: simulated or live execution result with price/size/latency/fees.
+- **SimReport**: deterministic simulator assumptions and output fingerprint.
+- **RiskState**: FSM mode and active triggers/cooldowns.
+- **GapScore**: scalar drift score between simulation and shadow/live observations.
+- **CanaryPhase**: staged allocation ramp (5→15→35→70→100) with rollback gates.
+- **Fingerprint**: sha256 hash over canonicalized payload and declared input set.
+- **EvidencePack**: complete logs/manifests/verdict for a run.
+- **Manifest**: immutable metadata file chaining hashes and schema versions.
 
 ## Module Boundaries
-1. **Data Plane (E31)**: point-in-time market data snapshots, deterministic feature extraction, provenance manifests.
-2. **Execution Simulation Plane (E32)**: deterministic fill/slippage/latency/fee simulator with calibrated assumptions.
-3. **Strategy Product Plane (E33)**: immutable strategy manifests, semver compatibility checks, deterministic strategy runtime settings.
-4. **Decision Plane (E34–E35)**: signal generation to constrained intents to portfolio allocation.
-5. **Safety Plane (E36, E38, E39)**: risk FSM, kill-switch matrix, reality-gap auto-brake, shadow/canary governance.
-6. **Validation Plane (E37, E40)**: walk-forward anti-overfit court, leakage sentinel v2, release certification and clean-clone reproduction.
-
-## System Invariants
-- Offline-first verification by default; network-only checks require `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1` and must be isolated from default gates.
-- Determinism invariant: same manifests + seed + ordered inputs + pinned deps produce byte-identical fingerprints.
-- No look-ahead invariant: features at `t` may not depend on records with timestamp `> t`.
-- No live orders invariant: shadow harness emits intents only; all order-placement adapters disabled unless explicit future unlock gate.
-- Evidence invariant: each epoch emits required artifacts under `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/` and `reports/runs/`.
-- Numeric integrity invariant: forbid NaN/Inf, negative prices/sizes, non-monotonic timestamps.
-
-## Contract Catalog (Schemas to be implemented)
-All contracts must include:
-- `schema_version` (string)
-- `deterministic_fingerprint` (object containing algorithm + ordered field list)
-- `forbidden_values` (explicit anti-values and invariant clauses)
+1. **Data Plane (E31)**: point-in-time market snapshots and deterministic feature pipeline.
+2. **Simulation Plane (E32)**: deterministic microstructure simulator (slippage, latency, fee, partial fills).
+3. **Strategy Product Plane (E33)**: immutable strategy registry and compatibility checks.
+4. **Decision Plane (E34–E35)**: signal-to-intent transformation and portfolio allocation.
+5. **Safety Plane (E36, E38, E39)**: risk FSM, auto-brake, shadow guards, canary governor.
+6. **Validation Plane (E37, E40)**: overfit court, leakage sentinel v2, certification freeze.
+
+## Global Invariants
+- Offline-first default; no hidden network dependencies.
+- No look-ahead leakage in features or labels.
+- No NaN/Inf, negative prices, negative fees, or non-monotonic timestamps.
+- All numeric rounding follows deterministic policy: price to 1e-8, size to 1e-8, bps to 1e-4.
+- Hash policy is canonical JSON (`UTF-8`, sorted keys, stable arrays, fixed decimal serialization).
+- Evidence completeness is required before status claims.
+- Live order placement is disabled by default; shadow emits intents only.

-## Deterministic Fingerprint Rules
-- Algorithm: `sha256` over canonical JSON serialization.
-- Canonicalization: UTF-8, lexicographic keys, fixed decimal representation for floating values, UTC ISO-8601 timestamps.
-- Ordered arrays (e.g., feature vectors, positions) must define stable sort keys.
-- Fingerprints for derived artifacts must include input hashes + config hash + seed.
-
-## Data Discipline
-- Dataset snapshots are immutable, append-only, and point-in-time versioned.
-- Transformations must declare train/inference split behavior; normalization fit stats are train-only.
-- Each transformation stage emits manifest with parent hash chain.
-- Any schema evolution requires backward compatibility statement and migration notes.
+## Fingerprint Rules (Global)
+- Algorithm: `sha256`.
+- Material: canonical JSON payload + declared parent hashes + seed + schema version.
+- Drift definition: any fingerprint mismatch for identical inputs is a deterministic failure.
 
 ## Kill-Switch Matrix (Global)
-1. Max drawdown breach.
-2. Consecutive loss streak threshold.
-3. Gap score threshold breach.
-4. Slippage spike versus rolling baseline.
-5. Latency spike versus SLO.
-6. Rejection-rate spike.
-7. Data integrity failure (hash/schema/timestamp monotonicity).
-8. Determinism mismatch on replay.
-9. Manual emergency halt.
-
-Modes transition policy:
-- NORMAL→CAUTIOUS: any warning-level trigger.
-- CAUTIOUS→RESTRICTED: repeated warning or single severe trigger.
-- RESTRICTED→HALTED: critical trigger, or two severe triggers in rolling window.
-- HALTED exit requires cooldown + operator acknowledgment + successful replay verification.
-
-## Gating Strategy
-- Spec gate (`verify:specs`) validates heading/order/completeness across E01..E40 and ledger/index mapping.
-- Epoch runtime gates will be introduced as implementation proceeds (`verify:epoch31` .. `verify:epoch40`).
-- Two-run anti-flake requirement for `verify:specs` in this spec cycle.
-- Gate failure policy: fail-fast on determinism, leakage, safety, and evidence omissions.
-
-## Rollout Discipline
-- Edge epochs remain `READY` until implementation + gate evidence turns them `DONE`.
-- No promotion to live trading in this scope.
-- E40 defines freeze/certification with clean-clone reproducibility and immutable evidence bundle hashes.
+Triggers: max drawdown breach, consecutive loss streak, gap score breach, slippage spike, latency spike, rejection spike, data integrity failure, determinism mismatch replay, manual emergency halt.
+
+FSM:
+- NORMAL→CAUTIOUS: first warning trigger.
+- CAUTIOUS→RESTRICTED: repeated warning or one severe trigger.
+- RESTRICTED→HALTED: critical trigger or two severe triggers within rolling window.
+- HALTED exit: cooldown expired + operator ack + successful deterministic replay.
+
+## Gate Strategy
+- `verify:specs` validates template conformance and epoch coverage E01..E40.
+- Epoch verify commands (`verify:epoch31`..`verify:epoch40`) are mandatory implementation gates and are spec-defined in this cycle.
+- Two-run anti-flake is required for spec closeout evidence.
+
+## Release Discipline
+- Epochs 31..40 remain `READY` until implementation gates are green with evidence.
+- Live trading remains disabled; shadow-only governance is non-bypassable.
+- E40 certification requires clean-clone reproducibility and immutable evidence hashes.

 # EPOCH-31 — Deterministic Data Model + Point-in-Time Feature Pipeline
 
+## Operator Summary
+- This epoch is specification-only and implementation-ready.
+- It defines deterministic contracts, invariants, and gate semantics.
+- Offline-first, no-secrets, and no-live-order defaults are mandatory.
+- Evidence artifacts are required to claim completion.
+- Failure conditions are explicit and blocking.
+- Rollback path is required before implementation begins.
+- Contracts are designed for JSON Schema and TS-shape parity.
+- Fingerprint rules define reproducibility criteria.
+- Safety invariants are non-bypassable.
+- This document is authoritative for epoch implementation scope.
+
+## Where to look next
+- `docs/SDD_EDGE_EPOCHS_31_40.md`
+- `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/ANTI_PATTERNS.md`
+
 ## REALITY SNAPSHOT
-- Epochs 01..30 are legacy complete; E31 introduces first EDGE subsystem as specification-only artifact.
-- Existing repo has spec gates but no runtime `verify:epoch31` command yet.
+- E30 is DONE; E31 starts EDGE runway and must chain from E30 in ledger dependencies.
 
 ## GOALS
-- Define deterministic, point-in-time feature contract with explicit anti-leakage controls.
-- Specify evidence and gate requirements for implementation sprint.
+Produce an implementation-ready PiT feature contract that guarantees no look-ahead leakage, train-only normalization, and reproducible feature fingerprints across reruns.
 
 ## NON-GOALS
-- Build production feature engine code.
-- Introduce live-data network dependency in default path.
+- Implement extractor runtime code or data ingestion jobs.
+- Introduce network dependence in default verification path.
 
 ## CONSTRAINTS
-- Offline-first by default; network checks require `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1` and separate evidence.
-- Determinism: fixed seeds, ordered processing, stable hashes, reproducible manifests.
-- No secrets in repo and no live order placement by default (shadow-only).
+- Offline-first default; network tests only via `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.
+- Determinism required: stable ordering, fixed seeds, canonical hashing.
+- No live trading by default; shadow/canary remain no-order unless explicitly unlocked in future governance.
+- No secrets in repo or evidence artifacts.
 
 ## DESIGN / CONTRACTS
-- Contracts: `FeatureFrame`, `FeatureManifest`.
-- Invariants:
-  - Feature at timestamp `t` can only consume source rows where `ts <= t`.
-  - Normalization/scaler fit must use training partition only.
-  - Deterministic fingerprint formula: `sha256(dataset_hash + feature_hash + config_hash + seed)`.
-- Data flow: snapshot ingestion -> PiT extractor -> train-only fit stats -> feature frame emission -> manifest chain.
-- Look-ahead sentinel fixture: mutate future rows (`ts > t`) and assert feature at `t` is unchanged.
-- Forbidden values: NaN/Inf features, negative prices/volumes, non-monotonic timestamps.
+### Contracts
+- Schema: `FeatureFrame` and `FeatureManifest`.
+- Minimal `FeatureFrame` example:
+```json
+{"schema_version":"1.0.0","symbol":"BTCUSDT","ts_event":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","features":{"ret_1":0.0012},"feature_vector_order":["ret_1"],"deterministic_fingerprint":{"algo":"sha256","value":"<hex>"}}
+```
+- Minimal `FeatureManifest` example:
+```json
+{"schema_version":"1.0.0","snapshot_id":"snap-20260101","dataset_hash_sha256":"<hex>","feature_hash_sha256":"<hex>","config_hash_sha256":"<hex>","seed":12345}
+```
+### Invariants
+- For all rows, feature computation uses only records with `source_ts <= ts_event`.
+- Normalization fit statistics are derived from train partition only.
+- Timestamps are monotonic per `(symbol, bar_interval)`.
+- Forbidden values: NaN, Inf, negative price/volume.
+### Fingerprint rules
+- `fingerprint = sha256(canonical_json(dataset_hash + feature_hash + config_hash + seed + schema_version))`.
+- Canonical JSON uses sorted keys and deterministic decimal formatting (1e-8).
+- Any replay mismatch for identical inputs is deterministic drift (FAIL).
 
 ## PATCH PLAN
-- Author contract-first spec artifacts only; no runtime implementation in this epoch spec.
-- Keep compatibility with `specs/epochs/TEMPLATE.md` heading order and `verify:specs` requirements.
-- Record gate/evidence mapping for future implementation sprint.
+- Keep changes in docs/specs/gates only; no runtime trading logic.
+- Maintain canonical template heading order.
+- Keep dependency and gate mappings aligned with INDEX and LEDGER.
 
 ## VERIFY
-- `npm run verify:specs`
-- Future implementation gate target: `npm run verify:epoch31` with replay and sentinel fixtures.
-- Must fail test when future-data mutation changes feature at historical timestamp.
+- `npm run verify:specs` must pass.
+- Planned implementation gate: `npm run verify:epoch31`.
+- Gate inputs: epoch contracts + deterministic fixtures + seed config.
+- Gate outputs: gate log, contract validation log, deterministic replay diff, verdict file.
+- PASS semantics: all invariants hold, evidence complete, replay stable.
+- FAIL semantics: leakage/bypass/nondeterminism/missing evidence triggers FAIL.
 
 ## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/FEATURE_CONTRACTS.md`
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/LOOKAHEAD_SENTINEL_PLAN.md`
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/FINGERPRINT_RULES.md`
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/FEATURE_CONTRACTS.md` (final field list + types).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/LOOKAHEAD_SENTINEL_PLAN.md` (positive/negative controls).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/FINGERPRINT_RULES.md` (hash material and canonicalization).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch31/VERDICT.md` (PASS/BLOCKED rationale).
 
 ## STOP RULES
-- PASS: all invariants and fixture expectations are explicit and testable.
-- BLOCKED: any unresolved ambiguity in PiT boundary, normalization scope, or hash inputs.
-- Rollback trigger: remove E31 READY claim if deterministic fingerprint or sentinel design is incomplete.
+- BLOCKED if any contract field/invariant is ambiguous or untestable.
+- BLOCKED if deterministic fingerprint rules are incomplete.
+- BLOCKED if a safety invariant can be bypassed.
+- Rollback trigger: revert epoch READY claim and restore previous ledger/index dependency state with diagnostic note.
 
 ## RISK REGISTER
-- Risk 1: spec drift between data and feature schema. Mitigation: explicit schema versions and manifest chain.
-- Risk 2: large snapshot size increases extraction latency. Mitigation: chunked deterministic batching.
-- Risk 3: hidden timezone conversion causes leakage. Mitigation: UTC-only timestamps and parser checks.
-- Risk 4: feature ordering instability breaks hash reproducibility. Mitigation: fixed `feature_vector_order`.
-- Risk 5: train/test split mis-specified by operators. Mitigation: split metadata required in manifest.
-- Risk 6: floating-point drift across environments. Mitigation: pinned runtime/deps and serializer policy.
-- Risk 7: look-ahead test only covers one symbol. Mitigation: multi-symbol fixture requirements.
+- Leakage fixture does not cover multi-symbol joins. Mitigation: include multi-symbol positive control.
+- Rounding policy mismatch across tools. Mitigation: enforce decimal policy in contract.
+- Split-map corruption. Mitigation: hash split-map and verify before extraction.
+- Clock/timezone conversion mistakes. Mitigation: UTC-only timestamps and parser lint.
+- Feature ordering drift. Mitigation: explicit `feature_vector_order` invariant.
+- Evidence omission under pressure. Mitigation: required file checklist gate.
+- Schema evolution drift. Mitigation: schema_version bump policy and migration note.

 # EPOCH-33 — Strategy Registry + Contracts
 
+## Operator Summary
+- This epoch is specification-only and implementation-ready.
+- It defines deterministic contracts, invariants, and gate semantics.
+- Offline-first, no-secrets, and no-live-order defaults are mandatory.
+- Evidence artifacts are required to claim completion.
+- Failure conditions are explicit and blocking.
+- Rollback path is required before implementation begins.
+- Contracts are designed for JSON Schema and TS-shape parity.
+- Fingerprint rules define reproducibility criteria.
+- Safety invariants are non-bypassable.
+- This document is authoritative for epoch implementation scope.
+
+## Where to look next
+- `docs/SDD_EDGE_EPOCHS_31_40.md`
+- `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/AI_MODULE.md`
+- `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/ANTI_PATTERNS.md`
+
 ## REALITY SNAPSHOT
-- EDGE epoch is currently specification-only and depends on prior epoch contracts.
+- EDGE runway specs exist; this epoch defines implementation contract quality bar.
 
 ## GOALS
-- Define complete, implementable subsystem blueprint with explicit contracts and invariants.
-- Define safety/determinism proof gates and evidence expectations.
+Define immutable strategy product contracts with semver compatibility and breaking-change detection.
 
 ## NON-GOALS
-- Implement runtime code paths.
-- Enable live trading defaults.
+- Implement runtime logic or integrations.
+- Relax safety constraints or default offline policy.
 
 ## CONSTRAINTS
-- Offline-first by default; network checks require `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1` and separate evidence.
-- Determinism: fixed seeds, ordered processing, stable hashes, reproducible manifests.
-- No secrets in repo and no live order placement by default (shadow-only).
+- Offline-first default; network tests only via `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.
+- Determinism required: stable ordering, fixed seeds, canonical hashing.
+- No live trading by default; shadow/canary remain no-order unless explicitly unlocked in future governance.
+- No secrets in repo or evidence artifacts.
 
 ## DESIGN / CONTRACTS
-- Contract: `StrategyManifest` with semver, params schema, and compatibility map.
-- Invariants: manifests immutable, breaking changes require MAJOR version bump.
-- Breaking-change detector compares `engine_api_version`, params schema, and data schema compatibility.
-- Registry is append-only with deprecation metadata.
+### Contract
+- Schema: `StrategyManifest`.
+- Example:
+```json
+{"schema_version":"1.0.0","strategy_id":"strat.mr","semver":"2.1.0","engine_api_version":"1.3.0","compatibility":{"min_data_schema":"1.0.0","max_data_schema":"1.x"},"deterministic_settings":{"seed_policy":"fixed"}}
+```
+### Invariants
+- Manifest is immutable after publish.
+- Breaking changes require MAJOR bump.
+- Params schema must validate default params.
+### Fingerprint rules
+- Hash includes params schema, defaults, compatibility map, artifact hashes, semver.
 
 ## PATCH PLAN
-- Author contract-first spec artifacts only; no runtime implementation in this epoch spec.
-- Keep compatibility with `specs/epochs/TEMPLATE.md` heading order and `verify:specs` requirements.
-- Record gate/evidence mapping for future implementation sprint.
+- Keep changes in docs/specs/gates only; no runtime trading logic.
+- Maintain canonical template heading order.
+- Keep dependency and gate mappings aligned with INDEX and LEDGER.
 
 ## VERIFY
-- `npm run verify:specs`
-- Future gate target: `npm run verify:epoch33` with epoch-specific fixture battery.
-- Must include explicit negative tests that fail when contract invariants are broken.
+- `npm run verify:specs` must pass.
+- Planned implementation gate: `npm run verify:epoch33`.
+- Gate inputs: epoch contracts + deterministic fixtures + seed config.
+- Gate outputs: gate log, contract validation log, deterministic replay diff, verdict file.
+- PASS semantics: all invariants hold, evidence complete, replay stable.
+- FAIL semantics: leakage/bypass/nondeterminism/missing evidence triggers FAIL.

 ## REALITY SNAPSHOT
-- EDGE epoch is currently specification-only and depends on prior epoch contracts.
+- EDGE runway specs exist; this epoch defines implementation contract quality bar.
 
 ## GOALS
-- Define complete, implementable subsystem blueprint with explicit contracts and invariants.
-- Define safety/determinism proof gates and evidence expectations.
+Define non-bypassable FSM risk governance with kill-switch matrix and cooldown semantics.
 
 ## NON-GOALS
-- Implement runtime code paths.
-- Enable live trading defaults.
+- Implement runtime logic or integrations.
+- Relax safety constraints or default offline policy.
 
 ## CONSTRAINTS
-- Offline-first by default; network checks require `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1` and separate evidence.
-- Determinism: fixed seeds, ordered processing, stable hashes, reproducible manifests.
-- No secrets in repo and no live order placement by default (shadow-only).
+- Offline-first default; network tests only via `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.
+- Determinism required: stable ordering, fixed seeds, canonical hashing.
+- No live trading by default; shadow/canary remain no-order unless explicitly unlocked in future governance.
+- No secrets in repo or evidence artifacts.
 
 ## DESIGN / CONTRACTS
-- Contract: `RiskState` with FSM modes NORMAL/CAUTIOUS/RESTRICTED/HALTED.
-- Kill-switch matrix includes drawdown, consecutive losses, gap_score, slippage spike, latency spike, rejection spike, data-integrity failure, determinism mismatch, manual halt.
-- Cooldown invariant: HALTED cannot be bypassed; exit requires cooldown + operator ack + replay pass.
-- Transition logs must carry evidence references.
+### Contract
+- Schema: `RiskState`.
+- Example:
+```json
+{"schema_version":"1.0.0","mode":"CAUTIOUS","active_triggers":["drawdown_warn"],"cooldown_until":"2026-01-01T01:00:00Z"}
+```
+### Invariants
+- FSM transitions allowed only NORMAL→CAUTIOUS→RESTRICTED→HALTED (and governed exits).
+- HALTED cannot be bypassed by manual toggle alone.
+- Kill-switch matrix includes DD, loss streak, gap score, slippage spike, latency spike, reject spike, data integrity failure.
+### Fingerprint rules
+- Hash mode, active triggers, cooldown, threshold config hash, and timestamp bucket.
 
 ## PATCH PLAN

-- Record gate/evidence mapping for future implementation sprint.
+- Keep changes in docs/specs/gates only; no runtime trading logic.
+- Maintain canonical template heading order.
+- Keep dependency and gate mappings aligned with INDEX and LEDGER.

-- Future gate target: `npm run verify:epoch36` with epoch-specific fixture battery.
-- Must include explicit negative tests that fail when contract invariants are broken.
+- `npm run verify:specs` must pass.

 # EPOCH-40 — EDGE Freeze + Release Discipline
 
+## Operator Summary
+- This epoch is specification-only and implementation-ready.
+- It defines deterministic contracts, invariants, and gate semantics.
+- Offline-first, no-secrets, and no-live-order defaults are mandatory.
+- Evidence artifacts are required to claim completion.
+- Failure conditions are explicit and blocking.
+- Rollback path is required before implementation begins.
+- Contracts are designed for JSON Schema and TS-shape parity.
+- Fingerprint rules define reproducibility criteria.
+- Safety invariants are non-bypassable.
+- This document is authoritative for epoch implementation scope.
+
+## Where to look next
+- `docs/SDD_EDGE_EPOCHS_31_40.md`
+- `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/AI_MODULE.md`
+- `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/ANTI_PATTERNS.md`
+
 ## REALITY SNAPSHOT
-- EDGE epoch is currently specification-only and depends on prior epoch contracts.
+- EDGE runway specs exist; this epoch defines implementation contract quality bar.
 
 ## GOALS
-- Define complete, implementable subsystem blueprint with explicit contracts and invariants.
-- Define safety/determinism proof gates and evidence expectations.
+Define certification and clean-clone reproducibility requirements for release freeze governance.
 
 ## NON-GOALS
-- Implement runtime code paths.
-- Enable live trading defaults.
+- Implement runtime logic or integrations.
+- Relax safety constraints or default offline policy.
 
 ## CONSTRAINTS
-- Offline-first by default; network checks require `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1` and separate evidence.
-- Determinism: fixed seeds, ordered processing, stable hashes, reproducible manifests.
-- No secrets in repo and no live order placement by default (shadow-only).
+- Offline-first default; network tests only via `ENABLE_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.
+- Determinism required: stable ordering, fixed seeds, canonical hashing.
+- No live trading by default; shadow/canary remain no-order unless explicitly unlocked in future governance.
+- No secrets in repo or evidence artifacts.
 
 ## DESIGN / CONTRACTS
-- Contract: `CertificationReport` linking epoch gates, hashes, and clean-clone proofs.
-- Certification checklist requires green `verify:epoch31..40` gates (implementation phase), regression pack, and ledger consistency.
-- Clean-clone reproducibility requirement: same fingerprints from fresh clone.
-- Evidence pack hash manifest is immutable and release-tagged.
+### Contract
+- Schema: `CertificationReport`.
+- Example:
+```json
+{"schema_version":"1.0.0","release_id":"edge-r1","epoch_gate_results":{"31":"PASS"},"ledger_snapshot_hash":"<hex>","evidence_hash":"<hex>"}
+```
+### Invariants
+- Certification requires all E31..E40 implementation gates green.
+- Clean-clone replay must reproduce certification fingerprint.
+- Evidence pack hash manifest must be immutable.
+### Fingerprint rules
+- Hash gate matrix, ledger snapshot, specs hash, evidence manifest hash.
 
 ## PATCH PLAN
-- Author contract-first spec artifacts only; no runtime implementation in this epoch spec.
-- Keep compatibility with `specs/epochs/TEMPLATE.md` heading order and `verify:specs` requirements.
-- Record gate/evidence mapping for future implementation sprint.
+- Keep changes in docs/specs/gates only; no runtime trading logic.
+- Maintain canonical template heading order.
+- Keep dependency and gate mappings aligned with INDEX and LEDGER.
 
 ## VERIFY
-- `npm run verify:specs`
-- Future gate target: `npm run verify:epoch40` with epoch-specific fixture battery.
-- Must include explicit negative tests that fail when contract invariants are broken.
+- `npm run verify:specs` must pass.
+- Planned implementation gate: `npm run verify:epoch40`.
+- Gate inputs: epoch contracts + deterministic fixtures + seed config.
+- Gate outputs: gate log, contract validation log, deterministic replay diff, verdict file.
+- PASS semantics: all invariants hold, evidence complete, replay stable.
+- FAIL semantics: leakage/bypass/nondeterminism/missing evidence triggers FAIL.
 
 ## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/SPEC_CONTRACTS.md`
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/GATE_PLAN.md`
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/ROLLBACK.md`
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/SPEC_CONTRACTS.md` (contracts + examples).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/GATE_PLAN.md` (inputs/outputs/pass-fail semantics).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/FINGERPRINT_POLICY.md` (hash material and drift definition).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/VERDICT.md` (PASS/BLOCKED with references).
 
 ## STOP RULES
-- PASS: contracts, invariants, stop rules, and rollback are concrete.
-- BLOCKED: unresolved ambiguity in thresholds or fail conditions.
-- Rollback trigger: failing critical gate twice without root-cause resolution.
+- BLOCKED if any contract field/invariant is ambiguous or untestable.
+- BLOCKED if deterministic fingerprint rules are incomplete.
+- BLOCKED if a safety invariant can be bypassed.
+- Rollback trigger: revert epoch READY claim and restore previous ledger/index dependency state with diagnostic note.
 
 ## RISK REGISTER
