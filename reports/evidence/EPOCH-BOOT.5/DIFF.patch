 # Pipeline (PLAN → BUILD → TEST → EVIDENCE → RELEASE)
 
 ## 1) PLAN
-- Validate assumptions and constraints.
-- Select epoch scope and minimal patch plan.
-- Register decisions/conflicts.
+- Write assumptions ledger and risk register.
+- Confirm SSOT inputs and resolve conflicts in `specs/SPEC_CONFLICTS.md`.
+- Produce minimal patch plan with rollback path.
 
 ## 2) BUILD
-- Implement minimal diff for selected epoch scope.
-- Keep default network-off behavior.
+- Implement minimal diff.
+- Preserve offline-first behavior and dry-run defaults.
+- Keep run-scoped output discipline (`TREASURE_RUN_DIR`).
 
 ## 3) TEST
-- Run target gates + anti-flake reruns.
-- Use run-scoped output directories.
+- Mandatory anti-flake baseline:
+  - `npm run verify:paper` (x2)
+  - `npm run verify:e2` (x2)
+- Determinism stress:
+  - `npm run verify:e2:multi`
+- Stability/supporting checks:
+  - `npm run verify:phase2`
+  - `npm run verify:integration`
+  - `npm run verify:core`
 
-## 4) EVIDENCE
-For each epoch evidence folder:
+## 4) EVIDENCE (mandatory structure)
+Each epoch folder must follow:
+`reports/evidence/EPOCH-XX/`
 - `PREFLIGHT.log`
-- `INSTALL.log`
+- `GATE_PLAN.md`
 - `gates/*.log`
 - `DIFF.patch`
 - `SHA256SUMS.SOURCE.txt`
 - `SHA256SUMS.EXPORT.txt`
 - `SUMMARY.md`
 
+Recommended additions: `INSTALL.log`, `SNAPSHOT.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `TREE_L2.txt`.
+
 ## 5) RELEASE
-- Build `FINAL_VALIDATED.zip` excluding `.git/`, `node_modules/`, temp caches.
-- Record `FINAL_VALIDATED.zip.sha256`.
-- Ensure evidence folder included in zip.
+- Build `FINAL_VALIDATED.zip`.
+- Exclude:
+  - `.git/`
+  - `node_modules/`
+  - global logs/caches/temp folders
+- Include source, specs/docs, truth schemas, verify scripts, and evidence.
+- Publish `FINAL_VALIDATED.zip.sha256`.
 
 ## CI Recommendations
-- Mandatory job: `npm run verify:core`.
-- Upload evidence folder and final artifact checksums as CI artifacts.
+- Required gate in CI: `npm run verify:core`.
+- Upload `reports/evidence/<EPOCH-ID>/` and export checksums as CI artifacts.

 # Spec Conflicts
 
-## C-001 — Epoch spec location
-- Conflict: task requested `specs/epochs/` as canonical location, but repo previously had no such directory and mixed planning across root/docs files.
-- Resolution: establish `specs/epochs/` as canonical epoch-spec location; keep root/docs files as references.
+## C-001 — Missing auxiliary planning files
+- Conflict: prompts referenced `TASK-*.md` and `PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md`, but repository does not contain them.
+- Resolution: treat `SDD_EPOCH_17_21.md`, `TASK_TRACKER.md`, and `docs/SPEC_OF_SPECS.md` as active planning inputs.
+- Action: keep this conflict open until missing files are restored or formally deprecated.
 
-## C-002 — Source of truth for next epoch planning
-- Conflict: request references `specs/epochs/` and additional tracker docs (`TASK-*.md`, `PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md`) that are missing.
-- Resolution: use available authoritative inputs in priority order: `SDD_EPOCH_17_21.md`, `TASK_TRACKER.md`, `docs/SPEC_OF_SPECS.md`; document missing files explicitly.
+## C-002 — Nonexistent future gates in epoch roadmap
+- Conflict: EPOCH-18..21 require gates (`verify:strategy`, `verify:governance`, `verify:monitoring`, `verify:prod`) that do not yet exist.
+- Resolution: mark these gates explicitly as **TO IMPLEMENT** in epoch gate docs and in matrix.
+- Action: each epoch implementation must add the gate script before claiming readiness.
+
+## C-003 — Determinism vs verify-only probes
+- Conflict: paper gate relies on verify-only synthetic probes when `FORCE_TRADES=1`.
+- Resolution: allowed for CI stability, but must remain wrapper-scoped and documented as synthetic in specs and evidence summaries.
+- Action: replace probes with deterministic trade fixtures in a future hardening pass.

 ## 9) Acceptance Criteria
+## E17 Safety & Live Execution Controls (mandatory)
+- Dry-run default MUST be preserved for all execution paths.
+- Live mode requires explicit mode switch + confirmation gate.
+- Emergency stop, kill switch, and circuit breaker are mandatory preconditions for live enablement.
+- No silent execution path: every order path emits audit events (SYS/EXEC/RISK).
+- Live audit logging is required and evidence-backed in epoch gate logs.

 - [ ] Target epoch modules implemented.
 - [ ] Baseline invariants pass.
 - [ ] Epoch-specific gate(s) pass.
 - [ ] Evidence folder complete and checksummed.
 
+## Implementation Reality Check
+- Can this be implemented with current modules? **YES (incremental)**.
+- New infrastructure required? **NO for baseline scope**, except epoch-specific gate scripts marked TO IMPLEMENT.
+- Estimated implementation size: **small-to-medium (200-600 LOC per epoch core path)**.
+- Refactor debt risk: **moderate** if interfaces diverge; minimize by adapter/wrapper reuse.
+- Incremental shipping feasible: **YES** (module + gate + evidence in sequence).

 ## 10) Risks & Mitigations
 - Risk: hidden nondeterministic fields in new outputs.  
   Mitigation: seed/clock discipline + schema and fingerprint checks.
