# ASSUMPTIONS (EPOCH-BOOT.5)
1. Spec-only changes should not regress runtime gates.
2. Existing wrapped gates maintain run-scoped output discipline.
3. New governance/spec files are source-manifest eligible.
4. Non-implemented future gates must be marked TO IMPLEMENT to avoid false pass assumptions.
