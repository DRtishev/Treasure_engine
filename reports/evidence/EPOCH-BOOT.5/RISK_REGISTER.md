# RISK REGISTER (EPOCH-BOOT.5)
- Risk: specs claim gates that do not exist yet.
  Mitigation: explicit TO IMPLEMENT markers + gate validation matrix.
- Risk: hidden spec contradiction between governance docs.
  Mitigation: SSOT hierarchy and conflict file with explicit resolutions.
- Risk: documentation drift from executable behavior.
  Mitigation: full baseline gate rerun and evidence capture.
