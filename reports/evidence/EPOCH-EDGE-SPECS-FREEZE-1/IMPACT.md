# Impact
- Added strict specs gate (`verify:specs:strict`) to enforce EDGE spec-freeze quality controls.
- Kept existing `verify:specs` unchanged to avoid regressions.
- Minor wording-only adjustments across EPOCH-31..40 to improve SSOT linkage and dependency detectability.
- Added docs-only artifact policy note in `specs/CONSTRAINTS.md` to prevent runtime artifact expectations during docs-only cycles.
