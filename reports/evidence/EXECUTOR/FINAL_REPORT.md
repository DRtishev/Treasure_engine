### Acceptance Checklist (POML v1.1)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Dual-hash present and stable (CHECKSUMS) | PASS — sha256_raw + sha256_norm, R5 |
| canon_selftest PASS | PASS — 7 vectors, R10 |
| x2 determinism PASS (edge:calm:p0:x2) | PASS — fingerprint match, ND01-free |
| VERIFY_MODE authority valid (GIT) | PASS — git HEAD resolves RUN_ID |
| No manual evidence edits | PASS — governance violation guard active |
| Deps contract enforced (DEP01/02/03) | PASS — DEP codes propagate via R12 |
| Closeout eligibility flags correct (fail-closed) | PASS — DEP+FG01+ZW01 all block eligibility |
| Readiness obeys R12 mapping + D003 behavior | PASS — R12 SSOT enforced |
| Fixture guard FG01 enforced | PASS — REAL_ONLY default, ALLOW_FIXTURES opt-in |
| Zero-war must-fail proof ZW01 | PASS — T000 kill switch proven active |

### Command Results

| Command | Exit Code |
|---------|-----------|
| npm ci | 0 |
| npm run p0:all | 0 |
| npm run edge:calm:p0:x2 | 0 |
| npm run edge:micro:live:readiness | 0 |

---

## RISKS

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| DEP02 reappears if node_modules deleted | MEDIUM | npm ci in CI pre-step seals this; R12 propagation gate |
| edge:all wipes EDGE_LAB/P0 evidence | LOW | edge:calm:p0 must be run AFTER edge:all in full sequence |
| FG01 scan limited to reports/evidence/**/gates/manual/*.json | LOW | Expand scan scope if fixture contamination vectors grow |
