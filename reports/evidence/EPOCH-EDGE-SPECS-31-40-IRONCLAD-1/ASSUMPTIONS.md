# Assumptions
- Task scope is docs/specs/verify-spec policy only; no runtime trading implementation.
- `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/EDGE_WOW_PROPOSALS.md` exists and is authoritative WOW input.
- `verify:specs` is the mandatory gate in this rewrite cycle.
- Future `verify:epoch31..40` commands are intentionally referenced as planned gates.
