# Rewrite Risk Register
- Risk: template non-compliance after rewrite. Mitigation: preserve mandatory epoch headings and checklist format.
- Risk: ledger/index chain drift. Mitigation: explicit dependency sweep for E31->E40.
- Risk: evidence theater. Mitigation: include full evidence pack and anti-flake logs.
- Risk: deterministic policy ambiguity. Mitigation: centralize in DETERMINISM_POLICY.md and reference from every epoch.
