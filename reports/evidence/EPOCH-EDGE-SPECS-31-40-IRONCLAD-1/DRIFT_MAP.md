# Drift Map (Recon)
1. Term drift existed between epoch specs and SDD for core contract names.
2. Rounding/hash/serialization rules were repeated with slight wording drift.
3. AI module lacked hard forbidden matrix for hidden network and self-trading behavior.
4. Anti-patterns were descriptive, not operationally test-linked.
5. Epoch gate semantics varied in precision of PASS/FAIL and evidence list language.
6. SDD references were not centralized to canonical policy docs.
7. WOW integration existed but not normalized as per-epoch prioritized hooks.
8. Stop rules varied in strictness and bypass resistance.
9. Fingerprint inclusion/exclusion rules were scattered.
10. Post-40 roadmap was mixed into active epoch prose rather than isolated planning.
