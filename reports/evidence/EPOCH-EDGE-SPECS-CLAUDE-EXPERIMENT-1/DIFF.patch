 ### Invariants
-- Gap components include slippage/fill-rate/latency/reject-rate/PnL deltas.
-- Brake action in {WARNING, REDUCE, FULL_STOP}.
-- FULL_STOP escalates RiskState to HALTED.
+- Gap components: delta_slippage_bps, delta_fill_rate, delta_latency_ms, delta_reject_rate, delta_pnl are all required.
+- gap_score is a composite scalar in [0, 1] derived from weighted component deltas.
+- Brake action mapping: gap_score thresholds determine action level.
+  - `gap_score < T_warn`: NONE.
+  - `T_warn <= gap_score < T_reduce`: WARNING.
+  - `T_reduce <= gap_score < T_stop`: REDUCE.
+  - `gap_score >= T_stop`: FULL_STOP.
+- FULL_STOP must escalate RiskState to HALTED (cross-epoch invariant with E36).
+- All thresholds (`T_warn`, `T_reduce`, `T_stop`) are **HEURISTIC** and require quarterly calibration.
+- Forbidden values: gap_score outside [0, 1], unknown brake_action.
+
 ### Fingerprint rules
-- Hash component deltas + threshold config + action decision policy version.
+- Material: `canonical_json(component_deltas + threshold_config + action_decision + policy_version + schema_version)`.
+- Drift definition: identical component deltas and config must yield identical gap_score and brake_action.

 ## RISK REGISTER
-- Contract ambiguity leads to inconsistent implementation. Mitigation: explicit examples + invariant tests.
-- Deterministic replay drift. Mitigation: stable ordering and canonical serialization checks.
-- Missing evidence blocks auditability. Mitigation: evidence completeness checklist gate.

-- HEURISTIC thresholds stale over time. Mitigation: scheduled calibration protocol and guardrails.
-- Dependency chain drift across docs. Mitigation: INDEX/LEDGER consistency checks.
-- Operator misuse due to unclear language. Mitigation: operator summary + concrete pass/fail semantics.
+- Gap drift ignored: large sim-shadow drift without brake escalation. Mitigation: gap_score thresholds with mandatory brake action mapping (Anti-pattern #14).
+- Backtest/live path mismatch causes persistent gap. Mitigation: shared contracts and replay parity gates (Anti-pattern #8).
+- Threshold values are **HEURISTIC** and may be miscalibrated. Mitigation: quarterly calibration protocol with documented data window and objective.
+- Gap score composition weights are subjective. Mitigation: weights documented as **HEURISTIC** with sensitivity analysis requirement.
+- FULL_STOP not wired to RiskState. Mitigation: cross-epoch integration test with E36 contract.
+- Stale shadow data produces misleading gap. Mitigation: shadow freshness check; stale shadow data triggers WARNING.

+- Phase skipping is forbidden; sequence must be strictly followed.
+- Rollback: any phase can revert to previous phase or to shadow (0%) on trigger.
+

-- Compile-time and runtime guards both required.
-- Canary phases must follow 5→15→35→70→100 sequence.

 ### Invariants
-- Certification requires all E31..E40 implementation gates green.
-- Clean-clone replay must reproduce certification fingerprint.
-- Evidence pack hash manifest must be immutable.
+- Certification requires all E31..E40 implementation gates to report PASS.
+- Any single epoch FAIL blocks certification (no partial certification).
+- Clean-clone replay must reproduce the certification fingerprint exactly.
+- Evidence pack hash manifest must be immutable after certification.
+- Approvals must include all required signoffs (defined in governance policy).
+- Forbidden values: any epoch gate result not PASS, missing approval signoffs.
+
 ### Fingerprint rules
-- Hash gate matrix, ledger snapshot, specs hash, evidence manifest hash.
+- Material: `canonical_json(epoch_gate_results + ledger_snapshot_hash + spec_hash + evidence_hash + schema_version)`.
+- Clean-clone test: fresh `git clone` + `npm ci` + full gate battery must produce identical certification fingerprint.
+- Drift definition: any fingerprint mismatch on clean-clone replay is a certification failure.
 
 ## PATCH PLAN
 - Keep changes in docs/specs/gates only; no runtime trading logic.

 ## VERIFY
 - `npm run verify:specs` must pass.
 - Planned implementation gate: `npm run verify:epoch40`.
-- Gate inputs: epoch contracts + deterministic fixtures + seed config.
-- Gate outputs: gate log, contract validation log, deterministic replay diff, verdict file.
-- PASS semantics: all invariants hold, evidence complete, replay stable.
-- FAIL semantics: leakage/bypass/nondeterminism/missing evidence triggers FAIL.
+- Gate inputs: CertificationReport contracts + all E31..E39 gate results + clean-clone replay environment.
+- Gate outputs: gate log, certification report, clean-clone replay log, verdict file.
+- PASS semantics: all epoch gates PASS, clean-clone replay reproduces fingerprint, evidence complete, all approvals present.
+- FAIL semantics: any of: epoch gate not PASS, clean-clone fingerprint mismatch, missing evidence or approval, hash mismatch.
+- Test vectors (from `docs/EDGE_RESEARCH/TEST_VECTORS.md`):

 ## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/SPEC_CONTRACTS.md` (contracts + examples).
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/GATE_PLAN.md` (inputs/outputs/pass-fail semantics).
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/FINGERPRINT_POLICY.md` (hash material and drift definition).
-- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/VERDICT.md` (PASS/BLOCKED with references).
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/SPEC_CONTRACTS.md` — CertificationReport field list, types, and examples.
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/GATE_PLAN.md` — gate inputs, outputs, and pass/fail semantics.
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/FINGERPRINT_POLICY.md` — hash material and drift definition.
+- `reports/evidence/<EVIDENCE_EPOCH>/epoch40/VERDICT.md` — PASS or BLOCKED with rationale and evidence links.
 
 ## STOP RULES
-- BLOCKED if any contract field/invariant is ambiguous or untestable.
+- BLOCKED if any E31..E39 epoch gate is not PASS.
+- BLOCKED if clean-clone reproducibility requirement is not specified.
+- BLOCKED if evidence hash manifest is not immutable.
+- BLOCKED if approval requirements are not defined.
 - BLOCKED if deterministic fingerprint rules are incomplete.
-- BLOCKED if a safety invariant can be bypassed.
-- Rollback trigger: revert epoch READY claim and restore previous ledger/index dependency state with diagnostic note.
+- Rollback trigger: revert E40 READY claim in LEDGER.json, restore prior dependency state, publish diagnostic note identifying which epoch(s) block certification.
 
 ## RISK REGISTER
-- Contract ambiguity leads to inconsistent implementation. Mitigation: explicit examples + invariant tests.
-- Deterministic replay drift. Mitigation: stable ordering and canonical serialization checks.
-- Missing evidence blocks auditability. Mitigation: evidence completeness checklist gate.
-- Safety invariant bypass under edge case. Mitigation: explicit negative fixtures and fail-fast checks.
-- HEURISTIC thresholds stale over time. Mitigation: scheduled calibration protocol and guardrails.
-- Dependency chain drift across docs. Mitigation: INDEX/LEDGER consistency checks.
-- Operator misuse due to unclear language. Mitigation: operator summary + concrete pass/fail semantics.
+- Evidence theater: PASS claim without actual gate execution or evidence. Mitigation: evidence completeness linter blocks certification without full evidence set (Anti-pattern #19).
+- Clean-clone irreproducibility: certification cannot be replayed on fresh clone. Mitigation: clean-clone replay gate with immutable evidence hashes (Anti-pattern #20).
+- Partial certification with failing epochs. Mitigation: all-or-nothing gate matrix; single FAIL blocks certification.
+- Stale LEDGER snapshot. Mitigation: ledger_snapshot_hash computed at certification time and included in fingerprint.
+- Approval process bypassed. Mitigation: required signoff fields in CertificationReport; missing approval is a FAIL.
+- Dependency drift between certification and deployment. Mitigation: pinned lockfiles and environment manifests verified during clean-clone replay.
+- Evidence omission. Mitigation: required file checklist gate blocks PASS without all evidence files.

+## TRAPS (Anti-Pattern Cross-References)
+- **#19 Evidence theater**: PASS claim without logs/manifests/verdict. Detection: evidence completeness linter.
+- **#20 Clean-clone irreproducibility**: certification cannot be replayed on fresh clone. Detection: E40 clean-clone replay gate.
+
+## WOW HOOKS (Optional Enhancements — Not MVP)
+- **WOW-35**: AI Research Agent Mesh — automated hypothesis factory with deterministic reproduction.
+- **D9 MAX**: Full governor automation (E40+ per decision matrix).
+
 ## NOTES
-- Rollback plan: revert EPOCH-40 spec, restore prior READY chain, and publish diagnostic evidence.
+- Rollback plan: revert E40 spec, restore prior READY chain, and publish diagnostic note identifying blocking epoch(s).
+- This is the terminal epoch of the EDGE runway. Successful certification unlocks post-E40 enhancements from the decision matrix MAX paths.
