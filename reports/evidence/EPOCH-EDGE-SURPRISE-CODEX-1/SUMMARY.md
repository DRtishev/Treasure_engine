# SUMMARY — EPOCH-EDGE-SURPRISE-CODEX-1

## Added surprise improvements
1. TRACEABILITY matrix linking each EDGE epoch to contracts, invariants, planned gate, and required evidence.
2. OPERATOR_PLAYBOOK with Day0/Day1/Day2 sprint rhythm and evidence checklist.
3. TEST_VECTORS spec with must-pass and must-fail fixtures for each epoch E31..E40.
4. SPEC_QUALITY_BAR guide describing verify:specs enforcement and fail examples.
5. Mermaid diagrams in SDD for system flow and gate/evidence flow.

## Why it matters
- Faster onboarding and execution for implementation sprint teams.
- Higher auditability and traceability from spec to evidence artifacts.
- Lower ambiguity in test planning and failure handling.
