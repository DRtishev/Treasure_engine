# WOW DELTA (Before -> After)

1. Before: gate/evidence mapping scattered. After: single-row epoch traceability table.
2. Before: no sprint cadence. After: explicit Day0/Day1/Day2 operator rhythm.
3. Before: fixture intent spread across docs. After: per-epoch must-pass/must-fail vectors.
4. Before: verify:specs rules implicit. After: explicit quality bar with failure examples.
5. Before: architecture was text-heavy. After: two mermaid diagrams for fast comprehension.
