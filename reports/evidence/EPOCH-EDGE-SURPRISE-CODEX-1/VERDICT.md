# VERDICT — EPOCH-EDGE-SURPRISE-CODEX-1

VERDICT: PASS

Reasoning:
- Surprise improvements were added without runtime code changes.
- verify:specs passed twice consecutively (anti-flake satisfied).
- Required evidence artifacts exist: preflight/install/gates/diff/summary/verdict/wow-delta.

Next target:
- Start E31 implementation sprint with TRACEABILITY + TEST_VECTORS as execution checklist.
