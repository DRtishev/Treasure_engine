# SUMMARY

## What changed
- Hardened SSOT foundations (glossary, determinism policy, contracts catalog) with canonical terminology, deterministic laws, and machine-checkable contract invariants.
- Added docs-only governance constraints and SDD term mapping for legacy-to-canonical consistency.
- Added planning-only post-40 roadmap (E41..E45) with no impact on active gate range.
- Collected full evidence pack for dual-run verify:specs.

## Why
- Remove ambiguity before E31 runtime implementation.
- Prevent drift in terms, determinism semantics, and contract definitions.
- Enforce reproducible spec closeout discipline.

## Gates
- verify:specs run1: PASS
- verify:specs run2: PASS
