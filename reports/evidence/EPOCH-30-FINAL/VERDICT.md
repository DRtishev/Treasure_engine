# VERDICT
Status: SAFE-WITH-LIMITATIONS

Limitations:
- Full canonical `verify:wall` completion is still in progress/iterative due long runtime and repeated multi-seed loops; partial logs are present.
- `verify:release-governor` requires final wall/export/checksum evidence to be complete in this cycle.
