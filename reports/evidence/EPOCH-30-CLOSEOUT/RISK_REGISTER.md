# Risk Register
- verify:wall may fail due to historical evidence assumptions and strict marker parsing.
- clean-clone could be flaky if bootstrap does not create all required files.
- release-governor may be coupled to old wall text output and ignore machine-readable outputs.
- checksum verification may fail if manifests are generated before all artifacts are finalized.
