EPOCH-23 SIGNAL->INTENT CONTRACT CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ same seed yields identical AI->signal output
✓ HOLD/zero-score decisions are skipped
✓ signal sides are normalized BUY/SELL
✓ notional_usd is finite and positive
✓ cross-seed output preserves structural signal count
✓ signal->intent conversion is deterministic
✓ intent count equals signal count
✓ intent contract contains deterministic ids and ai strategy ids
✓ intent sizing fields are finite
✓ mode remains DRY_RUN by default in epoch23 contract
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ PASSED: 10
✗ FAILED: 0
