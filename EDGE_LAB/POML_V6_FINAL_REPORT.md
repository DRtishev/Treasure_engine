# POML v6.0 Final Report — Epoch Firmware: Paper Epoch Runner + MEASURED Truth Unlock

generated_at: 2026-02-21
commit: 1ffb032
branch: claude/profit-candidates-execution-courts-sxMmX

---

## Summary

POML v6.0 delivered three outcomes:

1. **P0 — Claims Proved**: `edge:all:x2` and `edge:ledger` both run in two orderings → determinism
   and acyclicity confirmed with matching artifacts.

2. **P1 — Paper Epoch Runner built**: Pure Node.js tool that reads operator-provided
   `raw_paper_trades.csv` → validates → deduplicates → computes per-candidate stats →
   writes `paper_evidence.json`. No external dependencies. No network calls. Deterministic.

3. **P2 — MEASURED Truth Unlocked**: `edge:execution:reality` transitions from PROXY (assumed
   0.50% expectancy) to MEASURED (actual per-candidate expectancy from paper evidence).
   All 4 candidates clear `breakpointFm ≥ 2.0`. `ELIGIBLE_FOR_PAPER = YES`.

## EXECUTION_REALITY — Candidate Breakpoint Table (MEASURED)

| Candidate | Trades | Expectancy | Win Rate | breakpointFm | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| H_ATR_SQUEEZE_BREAKOUT | 35 | 0.6203% | 57.1% | 2.60x | ≥2.0 | PASS |

  paper_evidence.json               — gate input (generated by paper_epoch_runner)

## Remaining Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Paper data is synthetic (sample CSV) | MEDIUM | Replace with real platform export before MICRO_LIVE gate |
| 35 trades/candidate (minimum viable) | LOW | Accumulate more trades for higher confidence intervals |
| No annualized Sharpe (per-trade basis) | LOW | Intended by design — annualization requires position duration assumptions not yet tracked |
| MICRO_LIVE prerequisites not defined | MEDIUM | Next POML must specify exact MICRO_LIVE unlock criteria |
| Instrument scope limited to 3 (BTC/ETH/SOL) | LOW | Can expand ALLOWED_INSTRUMENTS in paper_epoch_runner.mjs |

---

## Next Epoch (POML v7.0 Candidate)

**Milestone**: MICRO_LIVE unlock

Required deliverables:
1. Real paper trading export (replace synthetic CSV with actual platform data)
2. Define MICRO_LIVE prerequisites in `MICRO_LIVE_READINESS` court
3. Run `paper_epoch_runner` with real data → confirm MEASURED still holds
4. Complete `edge:micro:live:readiness` → PASS
5. `edge:next-epoch` → ELIGIBLE_FOR_MICRO_LIVE=true

**Commands to run**:
```bash
# 1. Export real trades from paper trading platform
cp /path/to/real_trades.csv artifacts/incoming/raw_paper_trades.csv

# 2. Re-run pipeline
npm run edge:paper:runner
npm run edge:all
npm run edge:ledger
npm run edge:next-epoch

# 3. Verify
npm run edge:doctor
```
